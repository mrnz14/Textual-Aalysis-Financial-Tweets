# Textual-Aalysis-Financial-Tweets
This project analyzes financial tweets using machine learning to support hedge fund decisions. It involves data cleaning, sentiment analysis with RNN, LSTM, and optional BERT/FinBERT models, and validation through confusion matrices and accuracy scores. Media attention is quantified by counting tweets on specific stocks, ranking them by sentiment, and correlating media attention with stock returns to assess its predictive power. The script in this repo contains all the necessary code, along with step-by-step explanations of the results.
